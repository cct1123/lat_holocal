# lat_holocal 
This project is inherited from ```holosim-ml``` 📡 [https://github.com/McMahonCosmologyGroup/holosim-ml], which is a library for beam simulation and analysis of radio holography data from complex optical systems. We improve the computational performance and enhance the functionalites of the original ```holosim-ml```, and adapt the code for SO LAT holographic surface measurement.
